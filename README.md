# Personal Website

This repository hosts all of the necessary files used for rendering my personal site. Rather than trying to showcase my ability to write complex HTML and CSS codes (the languages can never be complex, anyway), I think it is more reasonable to list down the development tools and libraries I used to create this website.

### Theme
My website currently uses the Freelancer theme, a Bootstrap theme developed by Start Bootstrap.

### Development Tools
  - PUG - for easier to read and write HTML codes
  - GULP - for that "faster kick" when it comes to routine development tasks
  - LESS - for easier and more powerful CSS compilations
  - Visual Studio Code - for editing
  - Git - for version control
  - Google Chrome - for viewing
  - Command Line Interface - for efficient development and working speed

### Running My Website
I don't know why you'd want to, but you can clone my repository to a local repository of yours, and run the npm installation command (assuming you have NPM installed).
```sh
$ cd your-directory
$ npm install -d
```
