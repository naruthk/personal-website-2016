							<h1>Paradise Lost:</h1>
							<h2>Satan's March to Glory</h2>
							<p>This illustrated adaptation tackles John Milton's classic literary work, Paradise Lost, and brings to life the story
								mostly through the perspective of Satan, the fallen angel. All is lost for Satan after he has been kicked out of heaven.</p>
							<p>My adaptation will be loosely based on John Milton's original work.</p>

								The expansive and horrifying lake of fire, mixed with the unidentified terrains in Hell, made the involuntary visitors felt unwelcoming. They did not realize the unexpected - the climatic
								fall they did not ask for. A request one soul did not ask for nor wish. Their visit to a kingdom that neither mankind nor the most evil of the beasts on earth had ever stepped foot on before. </p>
							<blockquote>Flames forever lid. "Yet from those flames, no light but rather darkness visible..." (Book I, 62-3). Searching for hope? Be lost... for "hope never comes that comes to all" (Book I, 66-7). Such a tormented region of sorrow and darkness hell was.</blockquote>

							<h2>The Plan to Revenge God</h2>
							<p>Armed not with weaponry but with a dangerous and vicious mind, the castaway party devised a plan to wreck heaven, to end what is forever glorious, to dethrone the Father of Creation, for he is a leader that forces you to obey him or be punished.
								Satan had all of this in mind and he positioned himself as the commander of the fallen army, and met with praises and acceptance by his devil army that surrounded him. </p>
							<blockquote>"String laws imposed, to celebrate his throne with warbled hymns, and to his godhead sing forced hallelujahs; while he lordly sits our envied sovereign...", the evil commander spoke with anger (Book II, 241-4). </blockquote>
							<p>And through his speech the supporters added fuel to the burning flames.</p>
							<p>Who would it be, daring and bold, to get out of this inferno? Satan stepped up. Fear was not his trait. He journeyed through vast regions of Hell, made it out alive, and soared up to Heaven, only this time as a forbidden visitor named Satan.</p>

						<blockquote>Gabriel spoke, "Satan, I know your strength, and you know mine. Neither is our own but given. So why boast what our powers can do when the Father's power
